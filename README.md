# AutoFilter

~~The original application was meant for a wider usage area, for multiple people, but ended up just giving up since people don't trust me with their vps's ips! (what a shocker)
Which should explain why I made the discord bot ("server") seperate from the "client"~~

Works good... enough...

# Install
install.sh doesnt and I wont bother trying to fix it since everyone's linux is different

1. install `python3` and `pip3`
2. run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start it using: `tmux new-session -d -s bin 'python3 main.py'`

you will only need to install it once. if your vps restarts, just do step 3

# Setup
1. Create a private server
